            <p>I have been interested in coding since I was a little kid, about 8 years old. My older brother first introduced me to the basics of computers, and my interest peaked after that. I have always imagined myself working long hours of coding and getting lost in the technological world. </p>
            <p>I have also always been passionate about TV. Some of my favorite shows have been escapes for me since I was a young kid, before I even knew what coding was. Being introduced to coding enabled me to see a future where I could create projects based on those shows that I love. I frequently use quotes, themes, and characters in my coding projects. It brings out both my passion of coding and shows/movies.</p>
            <p>When I’m not coding, I spend time with my girlfriend and our newly adopted dog, Frankie. We all love chillin’ and watching Netflix. </p>
